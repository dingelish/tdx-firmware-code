# Build Environment

This repo contains a docker file for your convenience.  
SW prerequisites could be found in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (prerequisites could be installed also manually).  
Please note that the TDX module isn't part of the docker image and the user must build it according to the [instructions below](#how-to-build).  
The docker image is identical across all TDX versions, there is no need to rebuild it.

## Docker Container Build Instructions:

1. Clone/download the desired TDX module version ([Releases](https://github.com/intel/tdx-module/releases)).  
2. Build the Docker image from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (located inside the relevant repo) at the root:  
```docker build . -t tdx-module-docker```

3. Run the Docker container from the local created docker image:  
```docker run -ti --rm --net=host -v "$PWD":$HOME/tdx-module -w $HOME/tdx-module tdx-module-docker bash```  
NOTE: In order to run on Windows, replace the mount line with: -v "%CD%":$HOME/tdx-module


# How to Build
## Environment dependencies

-	Binary padding script

-   Compiled on Linux* OS

-	[IPP 2021.7.1](https://github.com/intel/ipp-crypto/releases/tag/ippcp_2021.7.1):

1) IPP can be automatically built by project's makefile.

    - IPP sources need to be placed under ./libs/ipp/ipp-crypto-ippcp_2021.7.1 folder.

    - Tools that are required to build IPP crypto lib described in the following [link](https://github.com/intel/ipp-crypto/blob/ippcp_2021.7.1/BUILD.md)

2) It could also be built separately with the following flags:

```bash
	cd <PROJ_DIR>/libs/ipp/ipp-crypto-ippcp_2021.7.1/

	CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake CMakeLists.txt -B_build -DARCH=intel64 -DMERGED_BLD:BOOL=off -DPLATFORM_LIST="y8" -DIPPCP_CUSTOM_BUILD="IPPCP_AES_ON;IPPCP_CLMUL_ON;IPPCP_VAES_ON;IPPCP_VCLMUL_ON";
	
	cd _build
	
	make -j8 ippcp_s_y8
```


## Make targets
Binary's generation includes the date it was compiled at, build number and module's update version.  

Build date, build number and update version could be extracted from the production binary, please use TDH.SYS.RD SEAMCALL (leaf #34) with MD_SYS_TDX_MODULE_VERSION_CLASS_CODE(8) as a class_code and MD_SYS_BUILD_DATE_FIELD_CODE(1)/MD_SYS_BUILD_NUM_FIELD_CODE(2)/MD_SYS_UPDATE_VERSION_FIELD_CODE(5) as field codes. The date format should be YYYYMMDD.  

Current TDX version was built with: TDX_MODULE_BUILD_DATE=20240129 TDX_MODULE_BUILD_NUM=698 TDX_MODULE_UPDATE_VER=5  

1) In order to reproduce the exact binary, it is required to specify the original date, build number and update version:

	```bash
	make RELEASE=1 TDX_MODULE_BUILD_DATE=20240129 TDX_MODULE_BUILD_NUM=698 TDX_MODULE_UPDATE_VER=5
	```

	In case binary reproduction is not required, "make RELEASE=1" will suffice.

2) Clean everything:

	```bash
	make clean
	```

3) Clean everything including the IPP:

	```bash
	make cleanall
	```
